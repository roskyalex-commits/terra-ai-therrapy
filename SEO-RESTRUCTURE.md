# SEO Restructure - Terra AI Therapy Website

## Overview
This document outlines the major SEO improvements made to the Terra AI Therapy website by converting from a single-page application with hash fragments to a multi-page structure with clean, indexable URLs.

## Previous Structure (Single Page)
```
https://talkswithterra.com/
https://talkswithterra.com/#services
https://talkswithterra.com/#about
https://talkswithterra.com/#blog
https://talkswithterra.com/#contact
```

**Problem:** Google treats all hash fragments as the same page, resulting in only ONE indexable URL.

## New Structure (Multi-Page)
```
https://talkswithterra.com/              (Homepage)
https://talkswithterra.com/services/     (Services page)
https://talkswithterra.com/about/        (About page)
https://talkswithterra.com/blog/         (Blog index)
https://talkswithterra.com/contact/      (Contact page)
```

### Blog Post Pages (New!)
```
https://talkswithterra.com/blog/what-is-ai-therapy-complete-guide/
https://talkswithterra.com/blog/ai-therapy-vs-traditional-therapy-comparison/
https://talkswithterra.com/blog/how-ai-therapy-works-science-technology/
https://talkswithterra.com/blog/best-ai-therapy-platforms-2024-review/
